Part C:

Britain has benefited in numerous ways from the rise of multiculturalism. The coexistence of diverse societies has resulted in the development of a new, distinct culture in Britain, which is an essential aspect of multiculturalism. This can be seen in a lot of British culture, like music, sports, food, art, and so on. For instance, the presence of emigrants from various nations has resulted in the development of new musical styles and instruments and the refinement of existing musical traditions. The same is true for sports, where the presence of immigrants has resulted in the introduction of new sports and an increase in the number of transnational players in teams. Multiculturalism has also had a significant impact on food, leading to the popularity of new recipes like curry and funk tikka masala in Britain.  In contrast to straightforward integration, in which emigrants simply arrive "British" and lose their previous identity, multiculturalism also permits the celebration of individual societies and heritages. In terms of languages, beliefs, leaves, attire, music, and ways of life, this diversity has caused a stir in the nation.  The United Kingdom has benefited financially, socially, and artistically overall from multiculturalism. Consequently, it has contributed to the foundation of a more diverse and creative nation as well as a more inclusive and tolerant society.
