Part A:

1." God is dead" is a expression used by Nietzsche to convey the idea that traditional Christian morality and belief in God is no longer applicable or important in people's lives.  

2. Christian morality is grounded on an interpretation of how the Bible reveals how God wants His people to live.  

3. From the Renaissance period onwards, moral proponents came more convinced that  commodity couldn't just be good or right because God said it was, and began to understand the problem of trusting the  opinions of man- made authorities like the church or monarch. At the same time, people won more individual rights, so were better  suitable to  condemn religious doctrine or the government without fear of  discipline.  

4. Bentham believed that morality was linked to the happiness in the consequences of an action.  

5. Moral relativism is considered dangerous because it allows for the possibility that there's no  similar thing as good and evil and that all ideas about morality are equal. This could lead to a society where there's no agreement on what's always wrong or what rights are inalienable, leading to lawlessness. 

Part C:

A good deed is one that helps everyone, no matter what the situation is. From my perspective, a good action is one that improves the well-being of all parties involved, regardless of the terrain or particular circumstances. A common and unprejudiced standard for determining what is right and wrong behavior is one of the arguments in favor of this viewpoint. This makes it easier to create a society that is fair and free of bias. Nonetheless, this viewpoint is also to blame for being overly simplistic and ignoring the complexities and nuance of colorful situations. Someone with a tone-centered personality fits the description of an evil person. From this point of view, a person's behavior and character ultimately determine whether they are good or bad.
