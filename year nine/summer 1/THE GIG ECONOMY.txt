SECTION A:

1. In the 19th century, dockers who unloaded ships were known as ‘lumpers’ and their work was back-breaking, dangerous, and low-paid. They were only paid when a ship came in, and their pay depended on how much cargo they could unload.

2. ‘Piecework’ refers to a system of work where a worker is not employed by a company but each piece of work they produce is bought by the company.

3. People might want to be self-employed because it offers freedom and flexibility and allows them to accommodate family, other interests, or personal goals.

4. It is hard for a young person to move out of home if they work in the ‘gig economy’ because they don't have a steady income, which makes it difficult to guarantee that they can afford rental accommodation or a mortgage.

5. The economic benefits of allowing this type of work include reduced costs for companies as they have no responsibility for holiday pay or maternity leave, and the ability to ‘flex’ their workforces according to demand.

SECTION C:

The ‘Gig Economy’, also known as the ‘freelance economy’ or ‘sharing economy’, refers to a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent jobs. The gig economy is often seen as offering greater flexibility and independence for workers, as well as providing businesses with a more flexible workforce.
One of the major benefits of the gig economy is the work-life balance it can offer. Workers in the gig economy can choose to work when and how much they want, allowing them to better balance their work and personal life. This can be particularly attractive to people with families, who need more flexible schedules, or to people who want to pursue other interests outside of work. Additionally, the gig economy provides opportunities for entrepreneurship and self-employment, which can be attractive to people who want to take control of their careers and work on their own terms.
However, the gig economy also has a number of drawbacks. One of the major drawbacks is the lack of job security and benefits that permanent employees typically enjoy. Gig workers are often paid less than permanent employees and are not entitled to benefits such as health insurance, paid time off, or a pension. Additionally, the gig economy can be expensive for workers, as they must provide their own equipment and bear the costs of self-employment, such as insurance. Finally, the gig economy can also contribute to the increasing cost of housing, as workers in the gig economy are less likely to be able to afford to purchase or rent a home, due to their unpredictable and often low income.
