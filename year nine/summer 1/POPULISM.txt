SECTION A:

1. The difference between the USA and Russia is described as polar opposites in ideology, with the Lithuanians eager to embrace democratic and liberal values represented by America and the Soviet Union being an authoritarian communist state. However, 25 years later, comparisons were being made between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the new US President Donald Trump because they prioritized achieving and maintaining power above everything, representing a new wave of populism.

2. Putin and Trump have in common that they prioritized achieving and maintaining power above everything and represented a new wave of populism.

3. Populists blame "liberal elites" who are corrupt and control the media and minorities (such as immigrants) who have undermined traditional values for society’s problems.

4. The irony about populist leaders is that they come from the wealthiest and most ‘elite’ segment of society, and manipulate the media with ‘Fake News’, while blaming liberal elites and minorities for society’s problems.

5. People from ethnic and religious minorities, and members of the LGBT+ community often suffer under populist regimes because the populist leader portrays them as the source of society's problems. The maintenance of power requires corruption, reduces democratic accountability, and encourages discrimination. Populist regimes often use referendums to bolster their support, and oppose proportional representation, creating an environment where these marginalized groups face discrimination and a lack of representation.

SECTION C:

Having many different political parties to choose from can be both a disadvantage and an advantage. On one hand, having multiple options can allow citizens to more accurately represent their political views and feel more represented in government. Additionally, having more parties can create a more diverse range of ideas and perspectives in government, leading to more thorough and representative discussions on policy decisions.
On the other hand, having too many parties can make it difficult for the government to make quick and decisive decisions. It can also lead to a fragmentation of the political landscape, making it harder for citizens to make clear and informed choices on election day. Furthermore, having too many parties can result in a constant need for compromise and bargaining, which can sometimes result in watered-down policies and decisions that do not effectively address the needs of the citizens.
Additionally, the focus on political leaders rather than policies can be problematic in a system with many parties. Voters may be swayed by the charisma or personality of a leader rather than the policies they propose, leading to misguided and uninformed decisions. The emphasis should always be on the policies and ideas being presented, rather than the individuals presenting them.
