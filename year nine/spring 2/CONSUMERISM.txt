Part A:

1. Consumer society refers to a social and economic order where individuals' identities, values and priorities are primarily shaped by the act of buying and consuming goods and services.

2. Warhol chose soup tins as a subject matter to comment on and question the values of the modern world, specifically the prevalence and impact of consumerism. He was interested in the idea of mass-production, mass-consumption and brand recognition.

3. Mass-production refers to the large-scale production of goods, typically in factories, through the use of assembly line techniques and standardized parts.

4. A benefit of consumerism is that it can increase wealth by creating jobs, growing businesses and allowing consumers access to affordable luxury and higher quality of life.

5. A disadvantage of the consumer society is that individuals can be manipulated into wanting and buying things they don't need or can't afford, leading to increased debt and waste. It also affects personal identity, leading to people being categorized by the brands they buy. The environmental impact of the disposable lifestyle is also a significant concern.

Part C:

Advertisements shape our understanding of what is desirable and companies use information they have gathered on our spending and consuming habits to influence our behavior as consumers. For example, a person may like a certain fashion brand and be influenced by their advertisements to buy more of their products. Similarly, a person may use a particular food and restaurant brand, which influences their dining choices. Social media companies also have a significant impact on how individuals consume information and can shape their perceptions and beliefs. Overall, corporations have a significant impact on our behaviors as consumers and shape our identities as consumers.
