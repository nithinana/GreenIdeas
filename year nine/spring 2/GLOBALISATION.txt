Part A:

1. Consumers (us) and producers (companies we buy goods and services from) are responsible for globalisation.

2. Quality, durability, and sustainability can be considered as good value instead of just low prices.

3. Globalisation has led to employment shift in the UK from manufacturing to service industries and technical/knowledge-based professions.

4. Companies must continually out-compete other businesses, expand their customer base, and grow in profit each year to be considered successful in a capitalist economy.

5. Globalisation has reduced absolute poverty and increased living standards, bringing consumer choice to all parts of the world and increasing the power of consumers in developed countries.

Part C:

Globalisation has been a controversial issue due to its impacts on culture, environment, and economy. Some believe that globalisation is a bad thing because it leads to cultural homogenisation, environmental degradation, and economic inequality.

The cultural impacts of globalisation include the loss of traditional customs and practices, and the imposition of Western cultural values. This can lead to a loss of cultural diversity and a sense of cultural displacement for many communities. Additionally, multinational corporations often market their products and values, leading to the Americanization of many parts of the world.

Overall, while globalisation has brought many benefits such as increased consumer choice and reduced poverty, it has also had negative impacts on culture, environment, and economy. It is important to address these impacts and find a way to promote sustainable globalisation that benefits all people and the planet.
