Part A:

1. Selective breeding

2. Gregor Mendel discovered that an organismâ€™s characteristics can be inherited from its parents.

3. Genetic engineering is the process of taking genes from one organism and placing it into another organism.

4.Genetic engineering is currently used to produce medicines, crops resistant to diseases and pests, and crops with added nutrients.

5.Some people object to GMOs due to beliefs that it is playing God or going against the natural order, potential long-term health effects, potential introduction of genetic disorders, and decreased farmland biodiversity.

Part C:

The idea of a "perfect human" varies and depends on personal and societal values. Genetic modification of humans could lead to increased abilities and resistance to diseases, but it also brings potential risks like unintended health problems, ethical issues, and creating unequal society. It is important to think about the ethical and societal effects before making a decision on genetic modification of humans.
