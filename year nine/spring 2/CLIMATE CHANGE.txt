1. Aldo Leopold's argument was about extending the idea of rights to the environment, including the land itself. He proposed a "Land Ethic" in which the environment should be protected based on moral duties beyond how we treat people.

2. Peter Singer promoted veganism because he argued that the suffering we cause to other species through food production and scientific research is immoral and cruel.

3. Global environmental problems such as acid rain and ocean pollution, as well as the depletion of the ozone layer, became better known in the 1980s and 90s.

4. Greenhouse gases are produced by the use of fossil fuels and activities such as cattle-farming. They are a problem because they are causing a rapid rise in global temperature, leading to climate change and its consequences such as sea level rise, migration, famine, and extinction.

5.Greta Thunberg wants to draw attention to the climate crisis and promote more effective and radical action to address it. She started the "School Strike for Climate" protest in 2018 to urge politicians to take action.

Part C:

To help reverse the effects of man-made climate change, individuals can make changes in their energy, transportation and shopping choices. Schools can promote eco-friendly practices and advocate for environmental awareness. Communities can participate in renewable energy initiatives, promote sustainable living and advocate for environmentally friendly policies at local and national levels. The international community needs to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable living on a global scale. As individuals, we can raise awareness, participate in activism and advocate for international policies to address the climate crisis. By making these changes, we can work towards a more sustainable future and help to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis.
