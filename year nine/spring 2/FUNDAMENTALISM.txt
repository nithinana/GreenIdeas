Part A:

1. Christian fundamentalist groups are common in the US.

2. Fundamentalist beliefs often lead to violence and/or terrorism due to the attitude of complete devotion to a perceived infallible "truth" and the idea of separation from mainstream society. This can lead to the use of force to bring about the return to an idealized society.

3. Fundamentalist groups want a return to a simpler form of life, often based on a literal reading of their religious text, which they believe provides the basis for how society should be structured.

4. Secular fundamentalism is the attitude of removing religious symbolism in order to return to a more secularized world.

5. Religious fundamentalists reject modern ideas because they view them as incompatible with their perception of a simpler, idealized society based on the fundamentals of their religion.

Part C:

Religious fundamentalism is becoming increasingly common in the 21st century due to several reasons:
Globalization and the spread of information technology has allowed for increased exposure to different cultures and ideas, leading some to seek refuge in their religious tradition as a source of stability and identity.
Political and economic instability in many parts of the world has led to a search for meaning and a sense of control in daily life.
The increasing diversity of modern societies has led to a sense of cultural insecurity and a desire for a return to a perceived simpler, traditional way of life.
The rise of secularism and the decline of religion in some areas has led to a desire to reclaim religious tradition and assert its importance in society.
A perceived erosion of traditional values and a sense of cultural threat has led to the adoption of fundamentalist attitudes by some people as a means of asserting their identity and values.
Fundamentalist attitudes can be attractive to some people because they offer a clear, black-and-white perspective on complex issues and a sense of belonging to a community with shared beliefs. Additionally, the strict adherence to a perceived infallible truth can provide a sense of certainty and stability in a rapidly changing world.
