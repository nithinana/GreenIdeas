1. Three deliberate mistakes in the definition of diffusion are:
The direction of movement is wrongly stated as from a region of lower concentration to a region of 
higher concentration, whereas it should be the opposite, i.e., from a region of higher concentration 
to a region of lower concentration.
The definition states that diffusion requires energy, which is incorrect. In reality, diffusion is a 
passive process that does not require any input of energy.
The definition does not specify that diffusion involves the movement of molecules from an area of 
high concentration to an area of low concentration along the concentration gradient.
Correct definition: 
Diffusion is the passive movement of molecules or particles from an area of high concentration to an 
area of low concentration along the concentration gradient, without requiring the input of energy.

2. Temperature increases molecular movement, causing faster diffusion.

3. Particle size, concentration gradient, and medium affect diffusion rate.

4. Photosynthesis in leaves; respiration in lungs involve diffusion.

5. Active transport moves molecules against gradient with ATP or electrochemical gradient.

6. Carrier proteins use ATP or electrochemical gradient to move molecules against gradient.

7. Plants: root cells use proton pumps to uptake minerals; animals: Na-K pump maintains membrane gradient.

8. The cell has a folded membrane to increase the surface area available for absorption.

9. The cell needs many mitochondria to provide energy for active transport and cellular processes.

(i) Arrow A represents the movement of oxygen molecules.
  
(ii) Arrow C represents the movement of carbon dioxide molecules.

(iii) Arrow B represents the active uptake of sugar molecules by the cell.

11. Active transport moves molecules against the concentration gradient, while diffusion allows for passive movement, both essential for aerobic respiration.

12. Active transport requires ATP, moves against the concentration gradient, while diffusion is passive and moves along the concentration gradient.
