1. Velocity is a measure of how fast an object is moving in a certain direction.

2. Speed = Distance divided by time

3. Units of speed are meters per second (m/s).

4. A horizontal line on a distance-time graph means the object is not moving.

5. The slope of a line on a distance-time graph represents the velocity of an object. The steeper the line, the faster the object is moving.

6. At a constant speed.

7. Uniform velocity is a constant speed in a specific direction.

8. The slope of a velocity-time graph represents the acceleration of an object. The steeper the slope, the greater the acceleration.

9. The area under a velocity-time graph represents the displacement of an object. The bigger the area, the greater the displacement.

10. A and C

11. Acceleration = change in velocity/change in time

12. The graph shows the change in velocity of a go-kart over time during the first 40 seconds of a race.
