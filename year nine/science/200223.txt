1. Cell

   Gene

2.DNA is made up of repeating nucleotide subunits consisting of sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base.

3. A is base
   B is deoxyribose
   C is phosphate

4. Double-stranded helix composed of nucleotides with base pairs A, T, C, G carrying genetic information.

5. Hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases hold the two strands of DNA together.

6. TAC GGC AAT GAC

7. No, the student is incorrect. Human body cells typically contain 46 chromosomes, with 23 inherited 7from each parent.

8. The phenotype of an organism depends on both its genotype (genetic makeup) and its environment.

9. Genes contain instructions for the development and function of proteins, which determine many physical and physiological traits of an organism, including its appearance (phenotype).

10.Inherited genes shuffled in meiosis/fertilization lead to unique combinations of traits.

11.Bacterial offspring are identical because they reproduce asexually via binary fission

12.Sexual reproduction increases diversity but requires a mate, asexual reproduction is efficient but lacks diversity.




MORE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION FOR QUESTION 12:

SEXUAL PRODUCTION:

Advantages:

Increases genetic diversity among offspring, which can increase the likelihood of adapting to changing environments.

Can help to reduce the risk of genetic diseases by allowing harmful mutations to be eliminated through natural selection.

Can lead to the evolution of new traits and species through genetic recombination.
Disadvantages:

Requires finding and attracting a mate, which can be energetically expensive and time-consuming.

Exposes offspring to genetic variability that can be detrimental if harmful mutations are present in the gene pool.

Can break up beneficial gene combinations, which can be disadvantageous in the short term.


ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION:

Advantages:

Is efficient, since no mate is needed.
Results in a high reproductive rate, allowing for rapid colonization of favorable habitats.

Avoids the risks of genetic variability, since offspring are genetically identical to the parent.

Disadvantages:

Lacks genetic diversity, which can limit adaptation to changing environments.
Cannot eliminate harmful mutations, leading to the accumulation of deleterious traits over time.
Cannot evolve new traits or species through genetic recombination.
