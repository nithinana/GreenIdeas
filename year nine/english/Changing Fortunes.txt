Section B:

Okonkwo's mistake in Chapter 13 has shattered his belief in his ability to achieve his lifelong goal of becoming one of the lords of the clan. Previously, he had been driven by a great passion and had dedicated his life to achieving this position. However, his violent act during the Week of Peace led to his exile, and he was left feeling hopeless and unable to regain his pride. This feeling of futility has changed his attitude towards success, and he now believes that his personal god or chi is not made for great things. Okonkwo realizes that a man's destiny is determined by his chi, and that a man cannot rise beyond it. The saying of the elders that a man's chi affirms his affirmation is not true for Okonkwo, as his chi has said "nay" despite his own affirmation. In short, Okonkwo's mistake has left him feeling despondent and unsure about his ability to achieve his lifelong goal.
